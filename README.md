# CertRollover

CertRollover is an offline PKI certificate rollover impact assessment service for platform-security teams. It inventories public trust anchors, certificate chains, and dependent services, then simulates a proposed trust-anchor rollover against a frozen dependency snapshot.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:18537`. The application is decision support only: it does not retain private keys, issue or revoke certificates, deploy changes, or connect to production key-management systems. A simulation is not a substitute for a production PKI change review or independent approval.

## Capabilities

- Import and fingerprint public trust-anchor material while rejecting private-key storage.
- Validate public certificate chains with Go `crypto/x509` and record the offline result.
- Model service-to-service dependencies, trust references, ownership, environment, and criticality.
- Freeze inputs for deterministic rollover simulation, with evidence for time-window path failures.
- Require an independent reviewer before a scenario can move from `executing` to `verified`.
- Preserve request IDs, actor identity, before/after snapshots, hashes, algorithm version, and timing in audit records.

## Roles and demo accounts

| Role | Account | Password | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PKI administrator | `admin` | `admin123` | Full administration and verification |
| PKI operator | `operator` | `operator123` | Trust material, chains, dependencies, and simulations |
| Service owner | `owner` | `owner123` | Team-scoped dependency and scenario work |
| Security reviewer | `reviewer` | `reviewer123` | Independent scenario verification and audit access |
| Auditor | `auditor` | `auditor123` | Read-only audit access |

The seeded accounts are for local development only. Replace them and the JWT secret before any shared deployment.

## Architecture

| Layer | Technology | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web client | React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Material UI, Zustand | Five operational pages and permission-aware controls |
| API | Go 1.22, Gin, validator/v10 | JWT/RBAC, request handling, validation, state transitions |
| Domain | Go services, repositories, GORM | Transactional persistence, audit records, deterministic simulation |
| Data | PostgreSQL 16 | Production Compose database |
| Edge | Nginx | SPA fallback and same-origin `/api` proxy |

The principal model is `TrustAnchor -> CertificateChain -> DependentService -> downstream service`. A `RolloverScenario` stores a frozen version of that model and evaluates critical time points in the supplied overlap window. The API is namespaced below `/api/v1`; the backend health endpoint is `/healthz`.

## Main routes

| UI route | API resources | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/anchors` | `/trust-anchors`, `/certificate-chains` | Inspect trust-anchor fingerprints, validity, and chain references |
| `/chains` | `/certificate-chains`, `/trust-anchors`, `/dependent-services` | Review chain structure and offline validation |
| `/dependencies` | `/dependent-services`, `/certificate-chains` | Maintain dependency edges and find cycles |
| `/rollovers` | `/rollover-scenarios` and all core resources | Run, compare, replay, and transition frozen simulations |
| `/audit` | `/audit-logs` and entity projections | Filter audit evidence by request, actor, entity, and time |

Authentication is available through `POST /api/v1/auth/login`. All write endpoints produce an audit record. Simulation requests require an `Idempotency-Key`; repeated requests with the same key return the stored result.

## State and safety rules

`CertificateState` is calculated by the backend and shared in:

- `backend/internal/constants/certificate_state.go`
- backend models, DTOs, x509 validation, services, and tests
- `frontend/src/types/enums/certificate-state.ts`, stores, badges, and pages

`ScenarioState` is shared in:

- `backend/internal/constants/scenario_state.go`
- backend DTOs, services, routers, and state-machine tests
- `frontend/src/types/enums/scenario-state.ts`, stores, state badges, and rollover page

Valid scenario transitions are `draft -> simulated -> ready -> executing -> verified`, `executing -> rollback`, and `simulated/ready -> draft`. Invalid transitions return `409`; a creator attempting to verify their own scenario receives `409 REVIEWER_SEPARATION_REQUIRED`. Authorization failures return `403`, and unauthenticated requests return `401`.

Marking a simulated scenario `ready` is guarded by a backend release gate computed from the frozen simulation evidence (`backend/internal/algorithm/release_gate.go`, exposed as `release_gate` on the scenario response). Any critical-service break at any evaluated timepoint blocks the transition with `409 RISK_GATE_BLOCKED` and names the affected services and moments; non-critical breaks require a `risk_acceptance` note on the transition request, which is stored on the scenario and retained in the audit trail; a clean result passes directly. Re-running a simulation clears any previously recorded acceptance. The `/rollovers` page renders this verdict from the API rather than inferring it.

## Configuration and ports

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local configuration. `.env` is intentionally ignored by Git.

| Variable | Compose default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | `18537` | Nginx application port |
| `BACKEND_PORT` | `19537` | Go API port |
| `DB_PORT` | `57537` | PostgreSQL host port |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | `pki_rollover` | Database name |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | `pki` | Database user |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | local only | Database password |
| `JWT_SECRET` | local only | JWT signing secret, minimum 16 characters |

The Compose project is named `pki-certificate-rollover-impact`, has health checks for all services, and waits for each dependency to become healthy.

## Local development

```bash
go work sync
go build ./backend/...
go vet ./backend/...
go test ./backend/...

npm --prefix frontend ci
npm --prefix frontend run build
npm --prefix frontend test

cd backend && go run ./cmd/server
```

To run the self-contained SQLite manifest check:

```bash

```

The manifest starts the backend on `20537` with in-memory SQLite and waits for `/healthz`; it exits after the health check.

## Docker operations

```bash
docker compose config --quiet
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
```

`down -v` removes the local named PostgreSQL volume. Use it only when the local data can be discarded.

## Troubleshooting

- A failed Compose health check: inspect `docker compose logs backend frontend db` and verify the configured ports are unused.
- API requests returning `401`: authenticate again and send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- A simulation returning `409`: use a new idempotency key for a different scenario, or follow the state-machine transition order.
- A verification rejection: use a different security reviewer; the creator is deliberately barred from self-verification.
